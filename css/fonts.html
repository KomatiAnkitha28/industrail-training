This occasion commemorates the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, who was fondly known as Chacha Nehru.

        Children's Day is a reminder of the importance of children in our lives and in our society. It is a day to celebrate their innocence, their creativity, and their boundless energy. It is also a day to reaffirm our commitment to protecting their rights and ensuring their well-being.</p>

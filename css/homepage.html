            Their website acts as a navigation hub allowing visitors to choose between making reservations, browsing menus, ordering to-go, and more. 
            
            
            The navigation menu looks equally well on any screen and resolution by distributing the navigation options in a grid, or a two-dimensional structure that lets you arrange content in columns and rows. Notice how the multi-column layout can shrink to a single column where the items in the menu are represented as rows, depending on your device or browser screen size.</p>
